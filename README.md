We have the executable  unkown.exe that we will be analyzing to know what it does.

![[1 1.jpg]]
First thing we would do is to get the hash of  the executable
![[2.jpg]]

Then you can use virustotal to see if they were used before,whynot uploading the exe itself , in real world senario , you do not know if it contains some confedtinal data of the facililty that this exe was found in.so uploading it would be against the facility policy .

λ md5sum.exe unknown.exe.malz
b9497ffb7e9c6f49823b95851ec874e3 *unknown.exe.malz

λ sha256sum.exe unknown.exe.malz
3aca2a08cf296f1845d6171958ef0ffd1c8bdfc3e48bdd34a605cb1f7468213e *unknown.exe.malz


then i would be exportinig the exe string , many tools can be used , ill be using floss 
![[5.jpg]]

this would take sometime , so  I be doing some static analysis with pestudio to see the exe archtiture , imports while floss its doing its job .

![[6.jpg]]Well its gonna flag the functions that seem to be milicous ,however , it can be mistaken , because these functions can be part of a legimit executable .

floss finished getting the strings 
its a long file but there are some interesting strings 
![[7.jpg]]
These function may indicate that the exe is trying to enumerate processs and threads , its also using some meomry manuplation functions 

Now its time to do some dynamic analysis
Ill be setting procmon and tcp 
to look for process and connections that would be created by the executable

In my Remux I will set inetim and wireshark 
![[10.jpg]]


Then I will execute the file 
![[9.jpg]]

I got connection to wireshark and its quire interesting 
![[11.jpg]]

its requesting a DNS npm.upuntu.com 

I will take this as self deletion tirgger , if it did not find the domain it will delete itself if didn't have a call back .

so I set a fake dns domain in my hosts file 

![[12.jpg]]

then I will execute again ,and i got this 

![[13.jpg]]
![[15.jpg]]



these all has to be noted , to create the pattern

In my procmon i start filterng for process name , and operations

Till here we start understanding the functionallity of the executable . in part two ill continue demoenstrating the analysis .
